This repository provides a native iOS SDK that enables you to integrate SumUp's proprietary
card terminal(s) and its payment platform to accept credit and debit card payments
(incl. VISA, MasterCard, American Express and more). SumUp's SDK communicates transparently
to the card terminal(s) via Bluetooth (BLE 4.0) or an audio cable connection. Upon initiating
a checkout, the SDK guides your user using appropriate screens through each step of the payment
process. As part of the process, SumUp also provides the card terminal setup screen, along with the
cardholder signature verification screen. The checkout result is returned with the relevant
data for your records.

No sensitive card data is ever passed through to or stored on the merchantâ€™s phone.
All data is encrypted by the card terminal, which has been fully certified to the highest
industry standards (PCI, EMV I & II, Visa, MasterCard & Amex).

For more information, please refer to SumUp's
[integration website](http://docs.sumup.com/terminal-payment/).

## Installation

If you want to support the SumUp Air Register, please also read our additional
[Air Register setup guide](AirRegister/README.md).

### Manual Integration

The SumUp SDK is provided as an embedded framework `SumUpSDK.embeddedframework`
that combines a static library, its headers, and bundles containing resources such as
images and localizations. Please follow the steps below to prepare your project:

1. Add the `SumUpSDK.embeddedframework` to your Xcode project.
2. Link your app against `SumUpSDK.framework`.
3. Link your app against the following system frameworks:

        Accelerate
        AVFoundation
        ExternalAccessory
        MapKit

4. Add `-ObjC` to "Other Linker Flags" if not yet included.

5. Add the bundle provided in `SumUpSDK.embeddedframework/Resources`
   to your app target.

        SumUpSDK.embeddedframework/Resources/SMPSharedResources.bundle

> Note:
> You can use the [sample app](SampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp)
> that is provided with the SumUp SDK as a reference project.
> The Xcode project contains sample apps written in Objective-C and Swift.
> In your debug setup you can also call `+[SMPSumUpSDK testSDKIntegration]`.
> It will run various checks and print its findings to the console.
> Please do not call it in your Release build.

### Integration via CocoaPods

The SumUp SDK can be integrated via CocoaPods. Regardless if you use dynamic
frameworks (`use_frameworks!`), SumUp will always be added to your app as a
staticly linked library.

```ruby
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SumUpSDK'
end
```

To learn more about setting up your project for CocoaPods, please refer to the [official documentation](https://cocoapods.org/#install).

### Integration via Carthage

To integrate SumUp SDK into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "sumup/sumup-ios-sdk"
```

- Run `carthage update` to build the framework
- Drag the `SumUp` framework into your Xcode project
- Drag the `SMPSharedResources` resource bundle into your Xcode Project
- Add the `carthage copy-frameworks` build phase script, see the [Carthage guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application)
- Add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SumUp.framework` to the script's Input Files
- Add `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/SumUp.framework` to the script's Output Files

### Supported device orientation
The SDK supports all device orientations on iPad and portrait on iPhone.
Feel free to support other orientations on iPhone but please keep in mind that
the SDK's UI will be presented in portrait on iPhone.
See `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` in the sample app's
[Info.plist](SampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp-Info.plist#L54-L65)
or the "General" tab in Xcode's Target Editor.

### Privacy Info plist keys
The SumUp SDK requires access to the user's location, Bluetooth peripherals
and the device's microphone. If your app has not asked for the user's permission,
the SumUp SDK will ask at the time of the first login or checkout attempt. Please add the
following keys to your info plist file:

        NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
        NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription
        NSMicrophoneUsageDescription

> Note:
> - Please refer to the sample app's [Info.plist](SampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp-Info.plist#L38-L43)
for more information regarding the listed permissions required.
> - You can provide localization by providing a localized
[InfoPlist.strings](SampleApp/SumUpSDKSampleApp/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings) file.
> - For further information, see the iOS Developer Library on
[location usage on iOS 8 and later](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26),
[Bluetooth peripheral usage](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW20),
and [microphone access in iOS 7 and later](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW25).

## Getting started

### Import the SDK

To import the SDK in Objective-C source files, you can use `#import <SumUpSDK/SumUpSDK.h>`. If module
support is enabled in your project, you can use `@import SumUpSDK;` instead.

In Swift, use `import SumUpSDK`. You do not have to add any headers to your bridging header.

### Authenticate app
Before calling any additional feature of the SumUp SDK, you are required to set up the SDK with your Affiliate (Access) Key:
```objc
[SMPSumUpSDK setupWithAPIKey:@"MyAPIKey"];
```

> Note:
> `setupWithAPIKey:` checks for the user's location permission. Consequently,
do not call this method as part of the app launch. This method must be called on
the main queue.

### Login

Following app authentication, a registered SumUp merchant account needs to be logged in.
Present a login screen from your `UIViewController`, using the following method:
```objc
[SMPSumUpSDK presentLoginFromViewController:vc
                                   animated:YES
                            completionBlock:nil];
```


> Note:
> To log out of the SDK, please refer to `logoutWithCompletionBlock:`.

### Accept card payments
Once logged in, you can start using the SumUp SDK to accept card payments.

#### Prepare checkout request
Prepare a checkout request that encapsulates the information regarding the transaction.

For this, you will need to create an instance of `SMPCheckoutRequest`:


```objc
SMPCheckoutRequest *request = [SMPCheckoutRequest requestWithTotal:[NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@"10.00"]
                                                             title:@"your title"
                                                      currencyCode:[[SMPSumUpSDK currentMerchant] currencyCode]
                                                    paymentOptions:SMPPaymentOptionAny];
```

Please note that you need to pass an `NSDecimalNumber` as the total value.
While `NSDecimalNumber` is a subclass of `NSNumber` it is not advised to use the
convenience method of `NSNumber` to create an `NSDecimalNumber`.

#### Additional checkout parameters
When setting up the `SMPCheckoutRequest` object, the following optional parameters can be included:

##### Tip amount
A tip amount can be processed in addition to the `totalAmount` using the `tipAmount` parameter.
The tip amount will then be shown during the checkout process and be included in the response.
Please note that a tip amount cannot be changed during/after the checkout.
Just like the `totalAmount` it is an `NSDecimalNumber` so make sure to
not accidentally pass an `NSNumber`.

##### Transaction identifier
The `foreignTransactionID` identifier will be associated with the transaction
and can be used to retrieve details related to the transaction.
See [API documentation](http://docs.sumup.com/rest-api/transactions-api/) for details.
Please make sure that this ID is unique within the scope of the SumUp merchant account
and sub-accounts. It must not be longer than 128 characters.

```
// set an optional identifier
[request setForeignTransactionID:@"my-unique-id"];
```

##### Skip success screen
To skip the screen shown at the end of a successful transaction, the
`SMPSkipScreenOptionSuccess` option can be used.
When setting this option your application is responsible for displaying
the transaction result to the customer.
In combination with the Receipts API, your application can also send your own receipts,
see [API documentation](http://docs.sumup.com/rest-api/transactions-api/) for details.
Please note that success screens will still be shown when using the SumUp Air Lite readers.

#### Initiate Checkout Request
Start a payment by using the checkout request below:


```objc
[SMPSumUpSDK checkoutWithRequest:request
              fromViewController:vc
                      completion:^(SMPCheckoutResult *result, NSError *error) {
                      // handle completed and failed payments here
                      // retrieve information via result.additionalInfo
}];
```

### Update checkout preferences
When logged in you can let merchants check and update their checkout
preferences. Merchants can select their preferred card terminal and set up a
new one if needed. The preferences available to a merchant depend on their
respective account settings.

```objc
[SMPSumUpSDK presentCheckoutPreferencesFromViewController:self
                                                 animated:YES
                                               completion:^(BOOL success, NSError * _Nullable error) {
                                                 if (!success) {
                                                   // there was a problem presenting the preferences
                                                 } else {
                                                   // next checkout will reflect the merchant's changes.
                                                 }
                                               }];
```
